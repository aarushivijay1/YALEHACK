# YALEHACK

This was a team project build during the Hackathon held at Yale University. This extension was built for Twitch that would let the streamers try costumes on their characters. 

In this, we developed an appealing web application using CSS and HTML5 to let the users choose the costumes they want to try on. (Hat is working for now). 

- Developed the front-end by overlaying the live video stream with the 3D models using JavaScript. We are still working on adding more products and making the web app more attractive.

## GETTING STARTED 

- To use this following application, you should download the files on your desktop. 
- Run the index.html file and then choose from the options. 
- If you click on the hat, you will be asked to give the app the permission to use your camera. 
- Allow it and then enjoy how the hat looks on you. Use the arrows to navigate the 3D object on your head!
